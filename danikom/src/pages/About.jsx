        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Danikom is more than a business â€” we are a bridge connecting rural women cooperatives in northern Ghana 
          to the global market. We specialize in producing and exporting pure, unrefined Shea butter and African Black soap. 
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          By working directly with artisans, we empower local communities, ensure fair trade practices, and promote sustainability. 
          Our products reach homes in the USA, Canada, Poland, Italy, Bulgaria, Botswana, Zambia, Egypt, and beyond.
